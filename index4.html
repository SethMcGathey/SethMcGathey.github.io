Scott and Seth pretended that they were kite designers looking to team up with a kite distributor. Since the focus was mainly on design and functionality the content is purely and playfully pretend.</p>

              <h4>Tsuro Clone</h4>
              <p>Along with Becky Gahart and Matt Cordier, Seth created a virtual clone of the board game Tsuro. It was created with Node.JS. This was the first time any of them had worked with Node.js. Seth feels that he learned a lot from this project and that if he created the game again with that new knowledge he could drastically improve the code, making it more simple and completing it much more quickly.</p>
