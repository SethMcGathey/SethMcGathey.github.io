                <p>As a QA Automation Lead, I successfully planned and started Datassential’s first automation project, designing our Playwright automation project from the ground up.</p>               
                <p>My team looked to me for guidance on setting and enforcing QA and automation policies and standards to ensure the QA members remained organized and efficient from project to project, sprint to sprint, and across each of the many development teams they were assigned.</p>
                <p>Initially, being the sole automation engineer in the company provided me the opportunity to train manual testers to do automation. Later on, I got the opportunirty to onboard and integrate experienced automation engineers to the team.</p>
                <p>I built automated testing solutions capable of handling complex, high-volume data sets—spanning 80 countries and millions of locations—ensuring accurate validations, robust coverage, and smooth integration with our global data pipeline.</p>
                <p>This experience sharpened my ability to lead with clarity, communicate effectively across teams, and deliver consistent, high-impact QA and automation solutions.</p>

                <p>As a QA Automation Lead, I have extensive experience leading a diverse team of remote workers from different time zones and regions. I take pride in my ability to motivate and guide team members to reach their full potential, as evidenced by the fact that I have successfully turned several low-performing automation engineers into top performers.</p>
                <p>One of my most notable achievements has been personally overseeing the full conversion of three years' worth of Protractor tests to Cypress tests in under a year. This involved managing the entire conversion process from start to finish, including setting up the necessary infrastructure and providing ongoing training and support to team members. The success of this project speaks to my ability to manage complex initiatives and drive them to completion.</p>
                <p>Overall, my experience as a QA Automation Lead has taught me the importance of effective leadership, communication, and a results-driven approach to problem-solving. I am confident that my skills and experience will allow me to make a valuable contribution to any organization in need of a talented and dedicated automation lead.</p>

                <p>As a Quality Assurance Developer, I had the privilege of being trained by two highly knowledgeable mentors, who laid a solid foundation for my skills in this field. I went on to train several new Quality Assurance Developers who joined the team after me, passing on the expertise I had gained.</p>
                <p>One of my biggest achievements in this role was successfully training several manual team members to automate their own test cases, demonstrating my ability to effectively communicate technical concepts and share knowledge with others.</p> 
                <p>Additionally, I led a stabilization initiative that resulted in a 40% reduction in flaky test cases, which helped to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our QA processes.</p>

                <p>I took the initiative to explore Playwright independently and quickly identified its potential for large-scale automation. At Datassential, I was entrusted with selecting and implementing the company’s first test automation framework. I led the successful adoption of Playwright, building a scalable solution that supports coverage across 80 countries, manages millions of location records, and accommodates four language translations. This framework became a foundational part of our QA strategy and enabled faster, more reliable releases across multiple teams.</p>

                <p>During my time at Milwaukee Tool, I gained experience working with Jenkins, starting out using prebuilt jobs created by others. As my familiarity with Jenkins grew, I began to make modifications and create new jobs to meet the team's needs. When I first joined the automation team, we relied on manual processes to run build verifications, smoke tests, and regressions. Over time, I leveraged my expertise to automate these processes and set up builds to execute the tests automatically once a fresh release candidate had been cut. My experience with Jenkins has enabled me to streamline processes and optimize efficiency for my team.</p>

                <p>Drawing on my prior experience with JavaScript, Java, and C#, I found TypeScript to be an easy language to learn. I first started using it extensively while at Milwaukee Tool. There, I utilized it to set up the Protractor framework and develop numerous automation scripts. When transitioning from Protractor to Cypress, I continued to use TypeScript, which allowed me to leverage my existing knowledge and make the transition seamless. I have continued using it for my Playwright project at Datassential. Each new language I learn is an enjoyable experience, providing an opportunity to test and refine my programming skills while keeping my syntax skills sharp.</p>

I have also trained several individuals on Git and always emphasized the importance of learning the command line prompts before using any GUI to manage Git repositories. This approach has enabled my team members to have a deeper understanding of Git and its functionalities</p>
