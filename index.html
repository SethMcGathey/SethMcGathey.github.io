					<p>I am a programmer and board game designer. I love to travel whenever I can. The summer after my Freshman year of college I went to Costa Rica. Then, the summer after be junior year of college I went to Hungary and the Czech Republic. Both trips were amazing but the second one was much longer and I got to see a lot more and so it was my favorite. </p>
