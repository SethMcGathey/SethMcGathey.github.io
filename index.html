					<h4>About Me</h4>

					<h4>Travel</h4>
					<p class="solid_Black_Border_1PX">I love to travel whenever I can. The summer after my Freshman year of college I went to Costa Rica. Then, the summer after my junior year I went to Hungary and the Czech Republic. Both trips were amazing but the second one was much longer and I got to see a lot more making it my favorite. The picture above is of me in Hungary playing with a toy penguin I had bought for my nephew.</p>

					<h4>Board Game Design</h4>
					<p class="solid_Black_Border_1PX">Early in 2015 I officially started my own board game company named Clash Games LLC. I have been designing games for years but have finally decide to send one to market. My goal is to run a Kickstarter towards the beginning of 2016 to fund the production of "We Missed the Ship", which is my first game to be released.</p>

					<h4>Programming</h4>
					<p class="solid_Black_Border_1PX">Board games are actually the reason I started on my programming career. I decided to use programming to develop my games into apps in hopes of furthering the reach of my board games. In the process of learning this skill, I fell in love with programming istelf and have begun focusing more on my programming career than on my board game development.</p>
