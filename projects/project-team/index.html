        <h4 class="sethParagraph">Seth McGathey</h4>
        <p class="sethParagraph">Seth McGathey originally started college with the goal of going for a liturature degree. After realizing this was not his passion, he moved on to trying to major in business. Still feeling like this was not the major for him he struggled to find what really drove him. Finally a friend turned him onto coding. He attended Wisconsin Lutheran College and earned his bachelors degree in computer science. Although he found work after graduating he was looking for a way to boost his career into better opportunities. To do this he joined the ranks of DevCodeCamp. This gave him a great opportunity to learn new programming languages and better his programming practices.</p>
        <h4 class="beckyParagraph">Becky Gahart</h4>
        <p class="beckyParagraph">Becky Gahart found a passion for programming in college during a writing class at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. As part of the class, each student was paired with a local non-profit to assist with writing projects. The non-profit that she was paired with did not have a website, so she built a website using HTML and CSS and wrote the content for it. She continued to maintain and update the website for the organziation for three years after the class ended. Ever since then, she has pursued learning programming languages in her free time, and eventually found herself at DevCodeCamp to learn how to take her skills to the next level. </p>
