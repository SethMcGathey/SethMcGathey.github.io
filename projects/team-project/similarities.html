        <p>Seth and Becky are both sports fans, but more than that, they are both team players. Some examples from their past expierences include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Becky has worked closely with attorneys, underwriters and lenders to efficiently close large commercial transactions. She has worked as an essential member of a team that must be quick to respond to issues and changes prior to closing.</li>
          <li>Playing sports throughout most of his life taught Seth the importance of teamwork to succeed. He learned that nobody can do as well by themeselves as one can when they work with a team. He has taken this lesson and applied to all aspects of his life.</li>
